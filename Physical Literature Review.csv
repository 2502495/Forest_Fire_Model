"On a self-organized critical forest-fire model","The critical exponents in the forest-fire model proposed by Drossel and Schwabl (1992) are not the classical ones, and typical states of the system are not marginally stable locally.","P. Grassberger",1993,45,"The author studies a forest-fire model introduced in a paper by Drossel and Schwabl (1992), by means of simulations with high statistics and very close to the critical point. In this way he can correct some statements made in that paper. In particular, he finds that the critical exponents are not the 'classical' ones proposed by Drossel and Schwabl. In spite of scaling laws with anomalous exponents, the typical states of the system are not 'critical' in the sense of being marginally stable locally.","","Journal of Physics A","","10.1088/0305-4470/26/9/007","https://consensus.app/papers/selforganized-forestfire-model-grassberger/ff1487d3f45f5df7bcf34d62564d2dc2/"
"Self-organized critical forest-fire model.","The self-organized critical forest-fire model allows for maximum energy dissipation and minimum forest density in a two-dimensional system, with a lightning probability f.","Drossel, Schwabl",1992,613,"A forest-fire model is introduced which contains a lightning probability f. This leads to a self-organized critical state in the limit f\ensuremath{\rightarrow}0 provided that the time scales of tree growth and burning down of forest clusters are separated. We derive scaling laws and calculate all critical exponents. The values of the critical exponents are confirmed by computer simulations. For a two-dimensional system, we show that the forest density in the critical state assumes its minimum possible value, i.e., that energy dissipation is maximum.","","Physical review letters","1","10.1103/PHYSREVLETT.69.1629","https://consensus.app/papers/selforganized-forestfire-model-drossel/28901fba5cd558b0981f7360bb587bc2/"

"Scaling laws and simulation results for the self-organized critical forest-fire model.","The self-organized critical forest-fire model reveals scaling laws and universal critical exponents, with a critical dimension of 6 suggesting mean-field values are universal across various dimensions.","Clar., Drossel, Schwabl",1994,79,"We discuss the properties of a self--organized critical forest--fire model which has been introduced recently. We derive scaling laws and define critical exponents. The values of these critical exponents are determined by computer simulations in 1 to 8 dimensions. The simulations suggest a critical dimension $d_c=6$ above which the critical exponents assume their mean--field values. Changing the lattice symmetry and allowing trees to be immune against fire, we show that the critical exponents are universal.","","Physical review.

"On the Asymptotic Density in a One-Dimensional Self-Organized Critical Forest-Fire Model","The density of vacant sites in a one-dimensional self-organized critical forest-fire model is of order 1/log (1/) after time of order log (1/), regardless of initial configuration.","J. Berg, A. Járai",2003,23,"AbstractConsider the following forest-fire model where the possible locations of trees are the sites of ℤ. Each site has two possible states: ‘vacant’ or ‘occupied’. Vacant sites become occupied at rate 1. At each site ignition (by lightning) occurs at ignition rate λ, the parameter of the model. When a site is ignited, its occupied cluster becomes vacant instantaneously.
In the literature similar models have been studied for discrete time. The most interesting behaviour occurs when the ignition rate approaches 0. It has been stated by Drossel, Clar and Schwabl (1993) that then (in our notation) the density of vacant sites (at stationarity) is of order 1/ log (1/λ). Their argument uses a ‘scaling ansatz’ and is not rigorous. We give a rigorous and mathematically more natural proof for our version of the model, and point out how it can be modified for the model studied by Drossel et al. Our proof shows that regardless of the initial configuration, already after time of order log (1/λ) the density is of the above mentioned order 1/ log (1/λ). We also obtain bounds on the cluster size distribution, showing that the scaling ansatz of Drossel et al. needs correction.","","Communications in Mathematical Physics","1","10.1007/S00220-004-1200-X","https://consensus.app/papers/density-onedimensional-selforganized-critical-berg/d030eccfad2c5772aeaa29bf6e7d2e27/"

"Self-organized critical forest-fire model: Mean-field theory and simulation results in 1 to 6 dimenisons.","The critical forest-fire model (FFM) is a self-organized critical branching process in the mean-field approximation, with increasing percolationlike behavior as dimension d increases.","Christensen, Flyvbjerg, Olami",1993,68,"We argue that the critical forest-fire model (FFM) introduced by Drossel and Schwabl [Phys.

The mean-field model of the FFM in finite dimension is the percolation model and, as in percolation, the upper critical dimension is 6. Simulations show that the FFM becomes increasingly percolationlike with increasing dimension d and is, within error bars, eully consistent with the percolation results when d≥3","","Physical review letters","1","10.1103/PHYSREVLETT.71.2737","https://consensus.app/papers/selforganized-forestfire-model-meanfield-theory-christensen/4fc6a6e920a250e89e922a0241343246/"

"Finite-size effects in the self-organized critical forest-fire model","The self-organized critical forest-fire model shows that tree density affects fire size distribution, leading to two types of fires: those that span entire patches and those that don't, with smaller system sizes leading to homogeneous densities.","Klaus  Schenk, Barbara  Drossel, Siegfried  Clar, Franz  Schwabl",2000,34,"Abstract:We study finite-size effects in the self-organized critical forest-fire model by numerically evaluating the tree density and the fire size distribution. The results show that this model does not display the finite-size scaling seen in conventional critical systems. Rather, the system is composed of relatively homogeneous patches of different tree densities, leading to two qualitatively different types of fires: those that span an entire patch and those that do not. As the system size becomes smaller, the system contains less patches, and finally becomes homogeneous, with large density fluctuations in time.","","The European Physical Journal B - Condensed Matter and Complex Systems","","10.1007/s100510051113","https://consensus.app/papers/finitesize-effects-selforganized-forestfire-model-schenk/c580812f0a1f5fb1b688e0e9528c7c12/"

As indicated in earlier publications, the forest-fire model does not show conventional critical scaling, but has two qualitatively different types of fires that superimpose to give the effective exponents typically measured in simulations. We show that this explains not only why the exponent characterizing the fire-size distribution changes with increasing correlation length, but allows us also to predict its asymptotic value. We support our arguments by computer simulations of a coarse-grained model, by scaling arguments and by analyzing states that are created artificially by superimposing the two types of fires.","","Physical review.

The time-invariant, scale-invariant characteristics of SOC of forest fire in China are analyzed in detail. The deviations between the occurrence frequency of very large fires and the power-law relation are explained by the forest-fire model with tree immunity (FFMTI). Actual forest-fire records are compared with the simulation results of a self-organized critical forest-fire model.
