10.1103/physrevlett.69.1629,10046273,,Self-organized critical forest-fire model.,"A forest-fire model is introduced which contains a lightning probability f. This leads to a self-organized critical state in the limit f\ensuremath{\rightarrow}0 provided that the time scales of tree growth and burning down of forest clusters are separated. We derive scaling laws and calculate all critical exponents. The values of the critical exponents are confirmed by computer simulations. For a two-dimensional system, we show that the forest density in the critical state assumes its minimum possible value, i.e., that energy dissipation is maximum.","Barbara Drossel,Barbara Drossel,Franz Schwabl,F.

We derive scaling laws and define critical exponents. The values of these critical exponents are determined by computer simulations in 1 to 8 dimensions. The simulations suggest a critical dimension $d_c=6$ above which the critical exponents assume their mean--field values. Changing the lattice symmetry and allowing trees to be immune against fire, we show that the critical exponents are universal.","Siegfried Clar,Siegfried Clar,Barbara Drossel,Barbara Drossel,Franz Schwabl,F.

In this way he can correct some statements made in that paper. In particular, he finds that the critical exponents are not the 'classical' ones proposed by Drossel and Schwabl. In spite of scaling laws with anomalous exponents, the typical states of the system are not 'critical' in the sense of being marginally stable locally.","Peter Grassberger,Peter Grassberger",Journal of Physics A,1993
10.1088/0953-8984/8/37/004,,,Forest fires and other examples of self-organized criticality,"We review the properties of the self-organized critical (SOC) forest-fire model. The paradigm of self-organized criticality refers to the tendency of certain large dissipative systems to drive themselves into a critical state independent of the initial conditions and without fine tuning of the parameters. After an introduction, we define the rules of the model and discuss various large-scale structures which may appear in this system. The origin of the critical behaviour is explained, critical exponents are introduced and scaling relations between the exponents are derived. Results of computer simulations and analytical calculations are summarized. The existence of an upper critical dimension and the universality of the critical behaviour under changes of lattice symmetry or the introduction of immunity are discussed. A survey of interesting modifications of the forest-fire model is given. Finally, several other important SOC models are briefly described.","Siegfried Clar,Siegfried Clar,Barbara Drossel,Barbara Drossel,Franz Schwabl,Franz Schwabl,F.

This model involves a growth parameterp, and the criticality is supposed to show up in the limitp→0. By simulating the model on much larger lattices, and with much smaller values ofp, we find that the correlations with longest range do not show a nontrivial critical phenomenon in this limit, though we cannot rule out percolation-like critical behavior on a smaller but still divergent length scale. In contrast, the model shows nontrivialdeterministic evolution over time scales ≫1/p in the limitp→0.","Peter Grassberger,Peter Grassberger,Holger Kantz,Holger Kantz",Journal of Statistical Physics,1991

The exponent is not universal; rather it depends on the level of conservation. A dynamical phase transition from localized to nonlocalized behavior is seen as the level of conservation is increased.

We show the existence of a relevant scaling field associated with a repulsive fixed point. This model is therefore critical in the usual sense because the control parameter has to be tuned to its critical value in order to get criticality. It turns out that this is not just the condition for a time scale separation. The critical exponents are computed analytically and we obtain v = 1.0, T = 1.0 and v = 0.65, T = 1.16, respectively, for the one- and two-dimensional cases, in very good agreement with numerical simulations.","Vittorio Loreto,Vittorio Loreto,L.

Bak et al. by including the immunity g which is the probability that a tree is not ignited although one of its neighbors is burning. When g reaches a critical value gc(p), which depends on the tree growth rate p, the fire cannot survive any more, i.e. a continuous phase transition takes place from a steady state with fire to a steady state without fire. We present results of computer simulations and explain them by analytic calculations. The fire spreading at the phase transition represents a new type of percolation which is called “fluctuating site percolation”.","Barbara Drossel,Barbara Drossel,Franz Schwabl,F.

The results show that this model does not display the finite-size scaling seen in conventional critical systems.

These are modeled by the random-bond Ising model and the dilute Ising model with either nonconserved (Glauber) spin-flip kinetics or conserved (Kawasaki) spin-exchange kinetics. In all cases, our MC results are consistent with power-law growth with an exponent $\ensuremath{\theta}(T,ϵ)$ which depends on the quench temperature $T$ and the disorder amplitude $ϵ$. Such exponents arise naturally when the coarsening domains are trapped by energy barriers that grow logarithmically with the domain size. Our MC results show excellent agreement with the predicted dependence of $\ensuremath{\theta}(T,ϵ)$.","Raja Paul,Raja Paul,Sanjay Puri,Sanjay Puri,Heiko Rieger,Heiko Rieger",Physical Review E,2005

10.1016/0378-4371(95)00015-y,,,Spreading analysis and finite-size scaling study of the critical behavior of a forest fire model with immune trees,"In a forest fire model with immune trees (FFMIT) recently proposed by Drossel and Schwabl (Physica A 199 (1993) 183), the sites of the lattice are either empty, a tree or a burning tree, and at each time step the system is updated in parallel according to the following rules: (i) A burning tree becomes an empty site, (ii) trees grow with probability p from empty sites, and (iii) a green tree becomes a burning tree with probability (1-g) if at least one next neighbor is burning. Fixing an arbitrary grow probability (p) and starting with a small immunity (g), increments of g causes the fire density of the steady state to decrease until the fire becomes irreversibly extinguished at a certain critical point of coordinates {pc, gc}. The set of critical points defines a critical curve gc (p) which, in the L = ∞ limit, divides the {p, g}-plane in two regions: a steady state with fire fronts for g < gc(p) and an unique absorbing state with all sites occupied by green trees for g ≥ gc(p). It is shown, by means of an epidemic spreading analysis that the continuous irreversible phase transition between the stationary regime and the absorbing state belongs to the same universality class as Reggeon field theory. It is found that within the absorbing state time correlations are short-ranged and that the fire density decrease exponentially. Within the stationary regime the irreversible transition is studied in terms of the finite-size scaling theory that was already developed to describe reversible transitions. The results reported in this work show that problems emerging from (apparently) unrelated branches of science such as particle physics, catalysis, directed percolation, and epidemic spreading can be understood by means of a unified description.","Ezequiel V.

A simple forest fire model, which is an example of self-organized criticality, exhibits similar behavior. One practical implication of this result is that the frequency-area distribution of small and medium fires can be used to quantify the risk of large fires, as is routinely done for earthquakes.","Bruce D.

We show that the model self-organizes spatially and temporally from random initial conditions into a well-defined state with a characteristic length and time scale. The time scale τ has a power-law dependence on the correlation length ξ, i.e., τ ≈ ξz with a non-trivial exponent of ≈ 0.83 in d = 2.

10.1103/physreve.57.6345,,,How self-organized criticality works: A unified mean-field picture,"We present a unified dynamical mean-field theory, based on the single site approximation to the master-equation, for stochastic self-organized critical models. In particular, we analyze in detail the properties of sandpile and forest-fire (FF) models. In analogy with other nonequilibrium critical phenomena, we identify an order parameter with the density of ``active'' sites, and control parameters with the driving rates. Depending on the values of the control parameters, the system is shown to reach a subcritical (absorbing) or supercritical (active) stationary state. Criticality is analyzed in terms of the singularities of the zero-field susceptibility. In the limit of vanishing control parameters, the stationary state displays scaling characteristics of self-organized criticality (SOC). We show that this limit corresponds to the breakdown of space-time locality in the dynamical rules of the models. We define a complete set of critical exponents, describing the scaling of order parameter, response functions, susceptibility and correlation length in the subcritical and supercritical states. In the subcritical state, the response of the system to small perturbations takes place in avalanches. We analyze their scaling behavior in relation with branching processes. In sandpile models, because of conservation laws, a critical exponents subset displays mean-field values $(\ensuremath{\nu}=$$\frac{1}{2}$ and $\ensuremath{\gamma}=1)$ in any dimensions. We treat bulk and boundary dissipation and introduce a critical exponent relating dissipation and finite size effects. We present numerical simulations that confirm our results. In the case of the forest-fire model, our approach can distinguish between different regimes (SOC-FF and deterministic FF) studied in the literature, and determine the full spectrum of critical exponents.","Alessandro Vespignani,Alessandro Vespignani,Stefano Zapperi,Stefano Zapperi",Physical Review E,1998
10.1016/0167-2789(88)90062-0,,,Singular perturbation theory of traveling waves in excitable media (a review),"Abstract   Waves of chemical or electrical activity, traveling through space, have been observed in several contexts: chemical reaction mixtures in non-convecting liquid phase, cell suspensions, nerve axons, and neuromuscular tissues. Typically, wave-supporting preparations are excitable; that is, they respond and sensitivity to perturbations are rapidly damped out, but suprathreshold disturbances trigger an abrupt and substantial response. The abruptness of the response can be exploited by the methods of singular perturbation theory to obtain a mathematical description of wave propagation in spatially distributed excitable media. Singular perturbation analysis of propagating waves in one spatial dimension is straightforward and uncontentious, but the analysis of propagating waves in one spatial dimension is straightforward and several fundamentally different ways. We compare and contrast the approaches taken by Greenberg, Zykov, Fife, Krinskii and his collaborators, and ourselves, with particular emphasis on the case of rotating spiral waves. Our intention is to bring some order to the important but difficult theory of propagating waves in two-dimensional excitable media. In conclusion we discuss briefly some possible extensions of the singular perturbation approach to propagating wave surfaces in three-dimensional space.","John J. Tyson,John J. Tyson,James P.

A Hamiltonian formulation is introduced which enables one to study the stationary state close to the critical point using quantum-mechanical perturbation theory. With this formulation also the structure of the low-lying relaxation spectrum and the critical behaviour of the smallest complex gap are investigated numerically. Finally, it is shown that critical correlation functions can be obtained from a simplified model involving only the total number of trees although such simplified models are unable to reproduce the correct off-critical behaviour.","A.

Theory of avalanche dynamics in models of growth, interface depinning, and evolution is presented. Specifically, we include the Bak-Sneppen evolution model, Sneppen interface depinning model, Zaitsev flux creep model, invasion percolation, and several other depinning models into a unified treatment encompassing a large class of far from equilibrium processes. The formation of fractal structures, the appearance of 1/{ital f} noise, diffusion with anomalous Hurst exponents, L{acute e}vy flights, and punctuated equilibria can all be related to the same underlying avalanche dynamics. This dynamics can be represented as a fractal in {ital d} spatial plus one temporal dimension. The complex state can be reached either by tuning a parameter, or it can be self-organized. We present two {ital exact} equations for the avalanche behavior in the latter case. (1) The slow approach to the critical attractor, i.e., the process of self-organization, is governed by a ``gap`` equation for divergence of avalanche sizes. (2) The hierarchical structure of avalanches is described by an equation for the average number of sites covered by an avalanche. The exponent {gamma} governing the approach tomore» the critical state appears as a constant rather than as a critical exponent. In addition, the conservation of activity in the stationary state manifests itself through the superuniversal result {eta}=0. The exponent {pi} for the L{acute e}vy flight jumps between subsequent active sites can be related to other critical exponents through a study of {open_quote}{open_quote}backward avalanches.{close_quote}{close_quote} We develop a scaling theory that relates many of the critical exponents in this broad category of extremal models, representing different universality classes, to two basic exponents characterizing the fractal attractor.

Cantharidin contents differ significantly between the sexes of adult O. femorata: 8.4 μ,g/female, 3.5 μg/male. Values for Sch. pectinicornis are more than 30-fold lower than those of O. femorata and no intersexual difference in the cantharidin content could be detected. Eggs of O. femorata contained cantharidin and larvae of this species are capable of synthesizing this terpenoid. The total amount of cantharidin increases in successive instars. In Sch. pectinicornis, the content of cantharidin decreases from egg to first instar. Feeding and copulation experiments with [ 2 H 2 ]cantharidin indicate that in O. femorata no or only very small amounts of cantharidin are transferred from males to females at copulation. Thus, males do not invest in the protection of their offspring by cantharidin gifts to the mate. For Sch. pectinicornis an intersexual transfer of labelled cantharidin during copulation was detected. About 45% of the entire cantharidin content in mated females derived from fed males. Analyses of eggs and first instar larvae show that a paternal allocation of 2 [H 2 ]cantharidin to developmental stages exists for this canthariphilous pyrochroid.","Chris Holt,C. Holt,G. Streil,G.

10.1016/j.physa.2015.11.022,,,Rise of an alternative majority against opinion leaders,"We investigate the role of opinion leaders or influentials in the collective behavior of a social system. Opinion leaders are characterized by their unidirectional influence on other agents. We employ a model based on Axelrod’s dynamics for cultural interaction among social agents that allows for non-interacting states. We find three collective phases in the space of parameters of the system, given by the fraction of opinion leaders and a quantity representing the number of available states: one ordered phase having the state imposed by the leaders; another nontrivial ordered phase consisting of a majority group in a state orthogonal or alternative to that of the opinion leaders, and a disordered phase, where many small groups coexist. We show that the spontaneous rise of an alternative group in the presence of opinion leaders depends on the existence of a minimum number of long-range connections in the underlying network. This phenomenon challenges the common idea that influentials are fundamental to propagation processes in society, such as the formation of public opinion.","K. Tucci,K.

10.1371/journal.pone.0016939,21483665,,Geographic Constraints on Social Network Groups,"Social groups are fundamental building blocks of human societies. While our social interactions have always been constrained by geography, it has been impossible, due to practical difficulties, to evaluate the nature of this restriction on social group structure. We construct a social network of individuals whose most frequent geographical locations are also known. We also classify the individuals into groups according to a community detection algorithm. We study the variation of geographical span for social groups of varying sizes, and explore the relationship between topological positions and geographic positions of their members. We find that small social groups are geographically very tight, but become much more clumped when the group size exceeds about 30 members. Also, we find no correlation between the topological positions and geographic positions of individuals within network communities. These results suggest that spreading processes face distinct structural and spatial constraints.","Jukka‐Pekka Onnela,Jukka-Pekka Onnela,Samuel Arbesman,Samuel Arbesman,Marta C. González,Marta C.

,,,LCPFCT-A Flux-Corrected Transport Algorithm for Solving Generalized Continuity Equations,"Abstract : Flux-Corrected Transport has proven to be an accurate and easy to use an algorithm to solve nonlinear, time-dependent continuity equations of the type which occur in fluid dynamics, reactive, multiphase, and elastic plastic flows, plasmadynamics, and magnetohydrodynamics. This report updates and supersedes a previous report entitled Flux-Corrected Transport Modules for Solving Generalized Continuity Equations. It can be used as a user manual for subroutines and test programs included in the appendices. The entire LCPFCT library in its most recent from is presented and discussed in detail. There are, in addition, discussions of more general topics such as the application of physical boundary conditions, physical positivity and numerical diffusion which help to put the numerical aspects to this subroutine library in context.","J.

10.1016/0370-1573(74)90023-4,,,The Renormalization group and the epsilon expansion,"The modern formulation of the renormalization group is explained for both critical phenomena in classical statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. The expansion in ϵ = 4− d is explained [ d is the dimension of space (statistical mechanics) or space-time (quantum field theory)]. The emphasis is on principles, not particular applications. Sections 1–8 provide a self-contained introduction at a fairly elementary level to the statistical mechanical theory. No background is required except for some prior experience with diagrams. In particular, a diagrammatic approximation to an exact renormalization group equation is presented in sections 4 and 5; sections 6–8 include the approximate renormalization group recursion formula and the Feyman graph method for calculating exponents. Sections 10–13 go deeper into renormalization group theory (section 9 presents a calculation of anomalous dimensions). The equivalence of quantum field theory and classical statistical mechanics near the critical point is established in section 10; sections 11–13 concern problems common to both subjects. Specific field theoretic references assume some background in quantum field theory. An exact renormalization group equation is presented in section 11; sections 12 and 13 concern fundamental topological questions.","Kenneth G. Wilson,Kenneth G. Wilson,John B. Kogut,John B.

,,,Model and theoretical seismicity,"abstract   A laboratory and a numerical model have been constructed to explore the role of friction along a fault as a factor in the earthquake mechanism. The laboratory model demonstrates that small shocks are necessary to the loading of potential energy into the focal structure; a large part, but not all, of the stored potential energy is later released in a major shock, at the end of a period of loading energy into the system. By the introduction of viscosity into the numerical model, aftershocks take place following a major shock. Both models have features which describe the statistics of shocks in the main sequence, the statistics of aftershocks and the energy-magnitude scale, among others.","Robert Burridge,R. Burridge,L.

10.1103/physrevlett.79.665,,,SPIRAL WAVE MEANDER IN EXCITABLE MEDIA : THE LARGE CORE LIMIT,We show that the dynamics of spiral waves in excitable media can be reduced to a nonlinear equation of motion for the wave tip that is asymptotically exact in a parameter range where the motion takes place around a large central core region. The onset of meander is shown to occur naturally in this range in the usual free-boundary limit where the medium exhibits an abrupt response to a stimulus. This equation provides a simple understanding of the physical origin of the meandering instability of spiral waves and of the quasiperiodic motion of the wave tip.,"Vincent Hakim,Vincent Hakim,Alain Karma,Alain Karma",Physical Review Letters,1997
10.1103/physrevlett.76.4285,10061248,,Dynamics of a traveling density wave model for earthquakes.,"We propose a unifying new framework for friction and earthquakes. Predictions from theory include (1) scaling exponents, and (2) metastable lifetimes for nucleating slip droplets. Earthquake simulations produce Gutenberg-Richter distributions of events with b values similar to observed declustered values, and populations of characteristic earthquakes, with associated aftershocks. Time is a relevant scaling field, justifying statistical time-to-failure analyses. When applied to integrate-and-fire neurons, the theory yields an explicit equation for the cell potential.","John B.

10.1103/physrevlett.76.940,10061590,,Simplest possible self-organized critical system.,"In order to pinpoint the nature of self-organized criticality, a simplest possible system exhibiting the phenomenon is introduced and analyzed. Its phase space is fully parametrized by two integer variables, one describing the state of a medium (sandpile), the other describing the state of a disturbance (avalanche) propagating in the medium, modifying it in the process. For asymptotically large systems, a scaling limit is obtained in which the system's state and dynamics is given by two real numbers and a simple partial differential equation. These results provide a full and transparent description of the dynamics that drives this system critical and keeps it in that state.","Henrik Flyvbjerg,Henrik Flyvbjerg",Physical Review Letters,1996
10.1103/physreve.51.1711,9962830,,Renormalization approach to the self-organized critical behavior of sandpile models.,"We introduce a renormalization scheme of a type that is able to describe the self-organized critical state (SOC) of sandpile models. We have defined a characterization of the phase space that allows us to study the evolution of the dynamics under change of scale. In addition, a stationarity condition provides a feedback mechanism that drives the system to its critical state. We obtain an attractive fixed point in the phase space of the parameters that clarifies the self-organized critical nature of these systems. The universality class of several models is identified by studying the properties of the basin of attraction of this fixed point. We compute analytically the avalanche exponent \ensuremath{\tau} and the dynamical exponent z for sandpile models in d=2. The values obtained are in very good agreement with computer simulations. The renormalization scheme can also be applied to study nonconservative sandpile models. The result is that the introduction of a dissipation parameter destroys the critical properties as suggested from simulations. The present theoretical framework seems particularly suitable for all SOC problems and can be naturally extended to other systems showing a critical nonequilibrium stationary state.","Alessandro Vespignani,Alessandro Vespignani,Stefano Zapperi,Stefano Zapperi,L.

It has long been known that these spirals are similar to involutes of circles, at least some distance from the center, but until now, no way has been known to determine the correct wavelength and frequency. In this paper, we show that the parameters of a spiral wave can be viwed s eigenvalues of a problem with unique solution. The critical ingredients of the theory are the effects of curvature on the propagation of wavefronts in two-dimensional media, and the dispersion of plane waves Our analytical results are shown to be in good agreement with experimental data for the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reagent.","James P.

10.1063/1.1348335,,,Collective modes in a strongly coupled dusty plasma,"It is widely recognized that in a typical dusty plasma encountered in the laboratory or outer space, the dust component is in a strongly coupled state because the interaction energy of neighboring dust particles due to shielded Coulomb (“Yukawa”) forces is much larger than their thermal energy. Low frequency collective modes involving the motion of dust particles are therefore greatly influenced by the strong correlation effects in the dust component. In this paper a dispersion relation for low-frequency collective modes using a generalized hydrodynamics model for the dust component has been derived. Strong correlation effects are described in terms of viscoelastic transport coefficients and a finite relaxation time for the memory kernel. Novel collective effects such as new corrections to dispersion terms for longitudinal dust acoustic waves and the existence of transverse shear waves supported by strong correlations have been identified.

10.1103/physreva.41.4199,,,Random packing of disks in two dimensions,"The geometry of a random dense packing of disks of equal size obtained by compacting a random sequential adsorption configuration is discussed. The configuration is shown to be without any long-ranged order, and no local configurations of ordered domains were found. The fraction of area covered by disks is {theta}=0.772{plus minus}0.002, and the number of contacts per disk are 3.02{plus minus}0.03. It is argued that this random packing is a stable configuration close to the random loose-packed limit in two dimensions. The packing fraction of the compacted packing is close to a prediction we make of {theta}=0.78 for a random loose-packed configuration. Several statistical distributions calculated from the limiting geometry is studied. Both the area and circumference distributions of the Voronoi-Dirichlet polygons could be fitted to {Gamma} distribution functions.","Einar L. Hinrichsen,Einar L.
